# SQL Library Manager

In this project I have built a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update, and delete books.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running for this project

steps will be:

- make sure you have npm and Node js installed, you can learn how to do that here: http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/

- Download the project files, [here is the link if you need it](https://github.com/luisgiraldov/sql-library-manager)

- Open your terminal/console and make sure to be inside the project folder.
for example
```
cd downloads/project_folder
```

- Then type in your terminal/console
```
npm install

That will install all project's dependencies

- Start your server by typing:
